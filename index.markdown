            Sophomore year at UIUC.
            I became interested in Trustworthy ML and worked with
            <a href = "https://ggndpsngh.github.io/" target = "_self">Professor Gagandeep Singh</a>
            on exploring adversarial attacks/defenses.

                I served in the South Korean military and worked at a startup called VisualCamp as a Machine Learning Research Engineer, under a government program that leverages military resources to enhance the nation's technology industry.
                I primarily worked on increasing the accuracy and optimizing the training & inference speeds of appearance-based gaze estimation models.

                After my freshman year, I interned at UIUC's Health Care Engineering Systems Center (HCESC) as part of the Jump ARCHES summer internship program.
                There, I built a COVID-19 alert app that recorded and analyzed vital signs of students entering a building
                to notify staff of those potentially infected.
